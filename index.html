      <h3>Instructions on how to play the game:</h3>
      <p>During each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice untile he/she rolls a 1 or decides to "hold".</p>
      <ol>
      <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the other player's turn.</li>
      <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
      <li>If the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score and it is the other player's turn.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>The first player to score 100 or more points wins!</h4>
